   * loader.c: Used to load images from a directory
   * hot-babe.c: Use of loader.c, added small optimisations, added a -n
                 (--nice) option to automatically nice the hot-babe. Added

   * hot-babe.c: Don't divide by zero (reported by different people),
	              some small optimisations, too.

   * hot-babe.c: applied a patch by  Pascal Terjan <pascal.terjan@free.fr>
                 which add the -N (--noNice) command line option. With this
                 option, the reniced processes aren't counted. This is usefull
                 if you use seti@home or distributed.net, which always eat
                 almost all the CPU.

   * hot-babe.1: added from the debian package, and somewhat improved it.
                 Added the -N option description.
