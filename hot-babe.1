.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hot-babe
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B hot-babe
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.

.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBhot-babe\fP is a small graphical utility which display the system activity in a very special way. When the CPU is idle, it displays a dressed girl, and when the activity goes up, as the temperature increases, the girl begins to undress, to finish totally naked when the system activity reaches 100%. Of course, if you can be shocked by nudity, don't use it!
.SH OPTIONS
As for now, \fBhot-babe\fP supports a few command-line options:
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
display a small help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-threshold n
ensure that only the first picture (totally dressed girl) as long as the system activity is below n%.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-delay
n update the display every n milliseconds.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-incremental
ponder every sample with time, the result is a somewhat smoother animation, and the cpu has to be 100% for a long time before the girl will be totally naked, and the cpu has to be at 0% for a long time for the girl to dress totally.
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-noNice
Don't consider reniced processes. This is usefull if you use seti@home or distributed.net, which always eat almost all the CPU.
.B \-n, \-\-nice
n Put the hot-babe process in nice n.
